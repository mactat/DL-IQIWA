# DL-IQIWA - Image quality improvement with autoencoders

In this project, we will work on an image quality improvement method. Given a set of high quality images, we will apply transformations that mimic the common quality issues. Then, we will train a network(autoencoder) to reconstruct the original, high quality image.
